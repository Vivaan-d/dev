# What is this?

Press the `.` key on any repository or pull request, or swap `.com` with `.dev` in the URL, to go directly to a VS Code environment in your browser or create a bookmark with the url: javascript:if (document.location.host == "github.com") {document.location = document.location.href.replace("github.com", "github.dev")} else {document.location = document.location.href.replace("github.dev", "github.com")}.

# Why?
Itâ€™s a quick way to edit and navigate code. It's especially useful if you want to edit multiple files at a time or take advantage of all the powerful code editing features of Visual Studio Code when making a quick change. For more information, see our [documentation](https://github.co/codespaces-editor-help).
